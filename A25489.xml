            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Mongſt the reſt of the great plots and Conſpiracies, contrived by the diſaffected Spirits, ſince the Revolution of theſe Times, the very laſt carryes a ſpecial Memento, whereby the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99445:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>people of England by thinking of it, may lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their diſobedience, and put themſelves into an holy Array, to meet the Lord, and bleſs his Name, for theſe his Mercies vouchſafed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in making ſo happy and timely a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this unlimited Conſpiracy: For, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it extended to all in general, except thoſe who ſhould come in and joyn with them; and not onely the Lord Protector, and the Honourable Lords of his Councel; but alſo divers members of Parliament, and Officers of the Army, ſhould have been expoſed to the mercy of mercileſs men, and have ſuffered in this bloody Aſſaſſination, had not Providence prevented it: For, 'tis ſaid, that they had entred into an Oath of Secreſie, to liſt men privatly, and to procure all ſuch Armes as ſhould make them formidable, in caſe of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for which end, they had bought many Blunderbuſſes, Muſquets, Carbines, and Piſtols, and had lodged them (as it is reported) in ſeveral places both in London and Weſtminſter, with a Reſolution to have put a period to the happy Conſtitution of this Government on Chriſtmaſs day, by ſurprizing of the ſeveral Guards at white-Hall, St. Jameſes, the Mewes, and other places. But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99445:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>one of the chief Conſpirators being at laſt ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly haunted with the Furies of a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, took an occaſion to reveal the ſame: In which great VVork, the true ſaying of a learned Author is verified; That when the Conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth, the Tongue confeſſes, the Eyes weep, the Hands wring, the Heartakes, and the Voyce cries; true it is, no part can be at eaſe.</p>
            <p>Upon which diſcovery, dtvers were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Armes before-mentioned ſeized and taken.</p>
            <p>Since which time, many Ship-Chandlers have been examined; and ſome Gunſmiths, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the number of Arms ſold within the ſpace of ſuch a time; but to whom, and for what uſe they could not tell.</p>
            <p>And upon ſufficient Evidence of their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, they were diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Great is the care of our prudent State to make a cleer diſcovery of the depth of the Deſign; and to find out the chief Fomentors thereof; to the end they may be brought to condign puniſhment and be made fit Objects of Juſtice.</p>
